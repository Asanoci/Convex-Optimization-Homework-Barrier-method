# Convex-Optimization-Homework-Barrier-method
 The goal of this homework was to implement the barrier method in order to solve a general quadratic problem with two Newton methods (damped Newton method and backtracking line-search Newton method). We then use these methods to solve the Support Vector Machine Problem.
